NAME
----
psm - Core memory and swap reporting

SYNOPSIS
--------
'psm' [-cpuprofile=<file>] [-memprofile=<file>]

DESCRIPTION
-----------
Makes it easy to see who is resident in memory, and who is
significantly swapped out.

psm is based off the ideas and implementation of ps_mem.py. It
requires root privileges to run - and as such is typically installed
as setuid root.
