NAME
----
psm - Core memory and swap reporting

SYNOPSIS
--------
'psm' [-cpuprofile=<file>] [-memprofile=<file>] [-heap] [-filter=<regexp>]

DESCRIPTION
-----------
Makes it easy to see who is resident in memory, and who is
significantly swapped out.

psm is based off the ideas and implementation of ps_mem.py. It
requires root privileges to run - and as such is typically installed
as setuid root.

OPTIONS
-------

-heap::
	Heap adds an additional column to the output with the amount
	of heap resident in memory (MB Rss).

-filter=<regexp>::
	Filter provides a way to report on a subset of running
	processes.  The regular expression format is the same as in
	Python or Perl, but for specifics see
	<https://code.google.com/p/re2/wiki/Syntax>

-cpuprofile=<file>::
	Records a CPU profile to the given file, suitable for use with
	'go tool pprof'.

-memprofile=<file>::
	Records a profile of memory allocations to the given file,
	suitable for use with 'go tool pprof'.
